"""Window capture abstraction.

`WindowCapture.grab_panel()` returns a PIL image of just the stat panel region.
Two implementations:

- `GameWindowCapture` (Windows only): finds the MapleStory window by title via
  pywin32, reads its client rect, grabs that rect off screen with `mss`. This is
  the real production path.
- `StaticImageCapture` (any platform): replays a single image file every call.
  Used for dev/testing on machines without the game running (e.g. this repo's
  Linux dev environment) -- proves out the OCR/parse/rate/overlay code without
  needing Windows + a live client.

Call `get_capture()` to get whichever is appropriate for the current platform;
pass `sample_path=` to force StaticImageCapture regardless of platform (useful
for demos/tests on Windows too).
